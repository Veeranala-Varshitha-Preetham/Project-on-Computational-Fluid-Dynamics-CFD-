# Advection–Diffusion Problem Simulation using MATLAB

##  Abstract
Energy demand and emission norms are motivating researchers to explore advanced combustion and flow technologies that ensure efficient performance while minimizing emissions.  
The Advection–Diffusion Equation (ADE) plays a vital role in modeling transport phenomena such as heat, mass, and pollutant transfer.  
This study focuses on simulating the one-dimensional Advection–Diffusion process using MATLAB to understand how concentration varies with space and time under the influence of both advection and diffusion mechanisms.

##  Objective
To develop a MATLAB-based numerical model for solving the one-dimensional Advection–Diffusion equation and to analyze how velocity and diffusion coefficients influence the transport of scalar quantities.

---

##  Governing Equation
The Advection–Diffusion Equation is represented as:

\[
\frac{\partial c}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial c}{\partial x} = D \frac{\partial^2 c}{\partial x^2}
\]

where:

| Symbol | Description |
|:--------|:-------------|
| \( c \) | Concentration of the transported quantity |
| \( u \) | Velocity of the flow (m/s) |
| \( D \) | Diffusion coefficient (m²/s) |
| \( t \) | Time (s) |
| \( x \) | Distance (m) |
where:  
- \( c \) → Concentration of the transported quantity  
- \( u \) → Velocity (m/s)  
- \( D \) → Diffusion coefficient (m²/s)  
- \( t \) → Time (s)  
- \( x \) → Distance (m)

##  Methodology
1. The governing equation is discretized using the **finite difference method**.  
2. Appropriate **initial and boundary conditions** are applied.  
3. The system is simulated using MATLAB to capture the transient behavior of the concentration field.  
4. Results are visualized using **surface and contour plots** to interpret the transport phenomena.

##  Results and Discussion
- The concentration distribution shows the combined influence of advection and diffusion.  
- **Advection** causes the movement of the concentration front along the flow direction.  
- **Diffusion** causes spreading and smoothing of the concentration profile with time.  
- Higher **velocity (u)** results in faster propagation, while higher **diffusion coefficient (D)** enhances mixing.  
- The simulation confirms that both parameters significantly affect how concentration evolves in space and time.

---

##  Conclusion
The MATLAB simulation effectively models the **Advection–Diffusion process**.  
It demonstrates the fundamental behavior of transport phenomena governed by the balance of convective and diffusive fluxes.  
The study provides a computational foundation for understanding pollutant dispersion, heat transfer, and similar physical processes encountered in fluid mechanics and environmental engineering.

---

##  Future Scope
- Extend the simulation to **two-dimensional and three-dimensional domains**.  
- Implement **implicit or Crank–Nicolson numerical schemes** for improved stability.  
- Introduce **source or sink terms** to represent generation or loss mechanisms.  
- Couple the model with **chemical reaction kinetics** or **variable velocity fields** for advanced applications.  
- Use **machine learning or optimization techniques** for parameter estimation and prediction of transport behavior.
