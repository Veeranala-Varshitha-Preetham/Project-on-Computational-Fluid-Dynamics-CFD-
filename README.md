Numerical study of 2D advection–diffusion of HCl in a 10 cm × 100 μm microchannel with slip walls (k1 = 5×10⁻⁶ m). Using explicit Euler, upwind advection and central diffusion, simulations for centreline speeds 0.1 mm/s–8 cm/s show transition from diffusion- to advection-dominated transport and slip-enhanced spread at t = 1 s.
